/*
You throw a ball vertically upwards with an initial speed v0 (in km per hour).
The height h of the ball at each time t is given by 
  
h=v0⋅t−0.5⋅gets⋅t⋅t
  
h=v0t−0.5⋅g⋅t⋅t, where g is the Earth's gravity (g≈9.81 m/s2)
(g≈9.81m/s2).

A device is recording at every tenth of second the height of the ball.

For example, with v0 = 15 km/h, the device gets something of the following form: (0, 0.0), (1, 0.367...), (2, 0.637...), (3, 0.808...), (4, 0.881..) ... where the first number is the time in tenths of a second and the second number the height in meter.

Task
Write a function with a parameter v0 (in km per hour) that returns the time in tenth of second of the maximum height recorded by the device.

Examples
Given initial speed v0 = 15 --> should return 4

Given initial speed v0 = 25 --> should return 7

Notes
Remember to convert the velocity from km/h to m/s or from m/s to km/h when necessary.
The maximum height recorded by the device is not necessarily the maximum height reached by the ball.
